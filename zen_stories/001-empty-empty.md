# Zen Story

Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era (1868-1912), received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.

Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, and then kept on pouring.

The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself.
* **"It is overfull. No more will go in!"**

* "Like this cup," Nan-in said
  * **You are full of your own opinions and speculations**
  * **How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?**

## Empty Empty

* **Aren't all opinions, in one way or other have come from external world - people?**
* Empty your cup completely, Empty yourself completely
* Including the ego thought that I have emptied and I am empty now
* When the ego I does not arise, What is really there shines
* It always shines and its ever there
* Because of the cloud of the ego I, what is there is not properly revealed
* Even the cloud itself is being lit by the light of that which is always present
